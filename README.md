This is Goblr a reverse image recognition software application for health. I worked on this project with Peter Soboyejo, Aaron Lam, Brian Li, and David Long. 
This app allows a user take a picture of food in order to find general nutritional information from the web.
This app also uses MRISA for reverse image searching and a DNB database for nutritional info.
