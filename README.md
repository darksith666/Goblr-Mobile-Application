# Goblr
This is Goblr which is what I worked on with a team: Peter Soboyejo, Aaron Lam, Mrigank Saksena, and David Long. 
This app lets a user take a picture of food in order to find general nutritional information from the web.
This app also uses MRISA for reverse image searching and a DNB database for nutritional info.
